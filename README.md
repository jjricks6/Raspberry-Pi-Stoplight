# How to create a Raspberry Pi Stoplight
### Created by Jordan Ricks

The goal of this project is to create a Raspberry Pi "stoplight" that can be controlled through a web interface. 

## Materials
* Raspberry Pi (I will be using a Pi 4b)
* 3 LED lights (Green, Yellow, and Red)
* A breadboard
* Some wires

## Design
Our stoplight should be able to work in both Manual and Automatic modes. In Manual mode, a user is able to select any light for the stoplight to switch to including an "off" state. In Automatic mode a timer starts in the Green state and moves between Green, Yellow, and Red states automatically. The user should be able to switch between these two modes at will using the web interface.
